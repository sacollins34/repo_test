# repo_test

I am making some edits to this README file using the Markdown! 

## This is a level 2 heading 

I can use simple text formatting to make **bold** or *italicized* text! 

## Branch edits

I'm feeling like a **MASTER** Coder 

## Making and Pushing Local Changes

I hope I am doing all this correctly 

"Here is some new text I am adding from the terminal to update the READ file." 

## Pulling Changes from GitHub

What is the most appropriate way to make the edits?
